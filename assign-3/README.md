# Assignment 3 – Data Visualization

This assignment focuses on **exploring the cleaned House Price Prediction dataset** (cleaned in Assignment 2) using different types of plots to uncover patterns and relationships.

## Tasks Completed

* **Class Task**:

  * Created a **bar chart**, **scatter plot**, and **histogram** to practice basic visualizations.
* **Assignment Plots**:

  * Generated **five unique plots** (Boxplot, Heatmap, Countplot, Pairplot, KDE plot) to analyze key factors affecting house prices.
  * Added a **short insight/observation** under each plot.

## Key Insights

* Higher **Overall Quality** ratings strongly increase **Sale Price**.
* **Living area (GrLivArea)** shows a positive correlation with price but includes a few high-value outliers.
* Most properties have **lot areas below 15,000 sq ft**, indicating a right-skewed distribution.
* **Attached garages** are the most common garage type.

## Files

* `Assignment3_Visualizations.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with all plots and insights.
* `train_cleaned.csv` – Cleaned dataset used for analysis.
