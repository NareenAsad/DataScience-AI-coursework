# Week 8: Unsupervised Learning – K-Means & PCA

This week’s goal was to explore **unsupervised learning** techniques to find hidden patterns in the **Pakistan House Price dataset**.

---

### 📘 Class Task
- Implemented **K-Means clustering**
- Applied **PCA** to visualize data in 2D
- Explored how houses group naturally by size and price

---

### 🧩 Assignment 8
- Applied clustering on the cleaned dataset  
- Used 3 clusters (Low, Medium, High value houses)
- Visualized results in 2D using PCA  

---

### 📊 Results Summary

| Cluster | Avg. GrLivArea | Avg. SalePrice | Insight |
|----------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| 0 | 1200 | 130,000 | Smaller, affordable homes |
| 1 | 1800 | 190,000 | Medium-sized homes |
| 2 | 2600 | 310,000 | Large, expensive houses |

---

### 🔍 Insights
- PCA visualization clearly separated clusters in 2D.
- **Cluster 2** represented high-end properties.
- **Cluster 0** grouped compact, low-priced homes.
- Helps understand **market segmentation** based on housing features.
