# Week 7: Model Evaluation

This weekâ€™s goal was to understand and apply **evaluation metrics** for classification models.

---

### Class Task
- Implemented **Confusion Matrix** to visualize correct vs incorrect predictions  
- Plotted **ROC Curve** and calculated **AUC score** to assess model discrimination ability  

---

### Assignment 7
- Evaluated **Logistic Regression** model using:
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score

---

### Key Results

| Metric | Value | Meaning |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Precision | 0.88 | How many predicted positives were correct |
| Recall | 0.89 | How many actual positives were correctly identified |
| F1-Score | 0.88 | Balance between precision & recall |

---

### Reflection
> **Recall** is the most important metric for my project because identifying high-priced houses correctly is crucial.  
> A missed high-value property (false negative) has higher cost than a false positive.
