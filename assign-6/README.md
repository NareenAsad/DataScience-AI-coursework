### 🏡 **Week 6: Supervised Learning – Classification**

This week focused on applying **classification algorithms** to the **Pakistan House Price Prediction dataset**.
The goal was to categorize house listings into **price classes** (e.g., *Low*, *Medium*, *High*) using different supervised learning models and evaluate their performance.

#### 📘 **Class Task**

* Implemented **Decision Tree Classifier**
* Implemented **Random Forest Classifier**
* Compared model accuracy and interpretability

---

#### 🧩 **Assignment 6**

* Applied **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest Classifier**
* Performed **Train/Test Split** on the dataset
* Evaluated both models using:

  * **Accuracy Score**
  * **Confusion Matrix**
  * **Classification Report**

#### 📊 Results Summary

| Metric    | Logistic Regression | Random Forest |
| :-------- | :-----------------: | :-----------: |
| Precision |         0.88        |      0.88     |
| Recall    |         0.88        |      0.88     |
| F1-Score  |         0.88        |      0.88     |
| Accuracy  |       **0.88**      |    **0.88**   |

#### 🔍 **Insights**

* **Random Forest** achieved the best accuracy by leveraging ensemble learning.
* **Logistic Regression** remains a great starting model for baseline comparison due to its simplicity.
* Adding engineered features such as **property size**, **number of bedrooms**, and **location encodings** could further enhance performance.
