### 🏡 **Week 6: Supervised Learning – Classification**

This week’s focus was on applying **classification algorithms** to the **Pakistan House Price Prediction dataset**.
We aimed to classify house listings into **price categories** (e.g., Low, Medium, High) using various supervised learning models.

---

#### **📘 Class Task**

* Implemented **Decision Tree Classifier**
* Implemented **Random Forest Classifier**
* Compared their performance on classification accuracy

---

#### **🧩 Assignment 6**

* Applied **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** models
* Performed **train/test split** on the dataset
* Evaluated both models using:

  * **Accuracy Score**
  * **Confusion Matrix**
  * **Classification Report**

#### **📊 Results Summary**

| Model               | Accuracy | Notes                                                       |
| :------------------ | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Logistic Regression | 0.81     | Simple and interpretable baseline model                     |
| Random Forest       | 0.89     | Better accuracy due to handling of non-linear relationships |

---

#### **🔍 Insights**

* **Random Forest** achieved the highest accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.
* **Logistic Regression** provided quick results and interpretability.
* Adding more engineered features (e.g., property size, number of bedrooms) can further boost performance.
