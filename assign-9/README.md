# Assignment 9 – Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This assignment implements a feedforward ANN using Keras to predict house prices.

## Tasks Completed
- Built ANN with Dense and Dropout layers.  
- Used ReLU activation and Adam optimizer.  
- Trained for 100 epochs with validation monitoring.  
- Evaluated MAE and RMSE against previous models.

## Key Insights
- ANN captured nonlinear relationships between features and SalePrice.  
- Achieved lowest MAE (~22 k) and RMSE (~34 k).  
- Deeper networks may require more data and regularization.
