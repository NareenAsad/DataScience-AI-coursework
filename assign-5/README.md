# Assignment 5 – Regression Analysis

This assignment implements **Linear Regression** using Scikit-Learn to predict house prices.

## Tasks Completed
- Performed **train/test split** (80/20).
- Trained a **Linear Regression model** on cleaned data.
- Evaluated using **MAE** and **RMSE**.
- Visualized actual vs predicted prices.

## Key Insights
- Model performs reasonably well; prediction errors are within an acceptable range.
- **MAE ≈ 26877**, **RMSE ≈ 35091** indicate moderate accuracy.
- Price increases linearly with living area and overall quality.
